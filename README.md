# Sentiment-Prediction-and-Analysis-On-Yelp-Dataset

Author: Yaoyang Zhang and Sri Krishna Vadlamani

This project implements a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network to predict ratings of reviews in Yelp Dataset based on pretrained word2vec word vectors. We achieve an accuracy of 56.9% and 54.1% on this 5-way classification problem with CNN and LSTM respectively, and beat a Naive Bayes baseline model based on bag-of-words features. We also explore the properties of text encoding in latent space based on our trained network.
